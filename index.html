            <p>Utah is a dry desert with enormous mountains, and goes through all four seasons so it's the perfect place for any outdoor activity you can think of. There are also lots of places you can travel to for a short trip like St. George, Zion National Park, Arches National Park, Bear Lake, and Salt Lake City. The food is pretty typical, but fry sauce is the one thing Utah has that most places don't, so it is a must try.</p>
